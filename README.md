# ffmq-poptracker
Archipelago Final Fantasy Mystic Quest [PopTracker](https://github.com/black-sliver/PopTracker/) pack.
Autotracking supported via Archipelago connection.

## Known Issues
There is currently no way of knowing how many Sky Coin Fragments you need to enter Doom Castle if you select that option, so you will need to manually give yourself the Sky Coin for tracking purposes.
